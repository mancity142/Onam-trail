Code implementation steps 

Plan for the project start with 


Prototype UI/UX with Figma (optional step for design).

Scaffold React app (using Create React App, Vite, or Next.js).

Style with Tailwind CSS.

Build backend (Express.js API + Socket.io).

Connect MongoDB/Firebase for event and winner data.

Integrate real-time updates with Socket.io.

Setup Plans for the project 

Step 1: Project Setup
1. Folder Structure
Create a directory for your project, e.g., event-web-app. Inside, make folders:

/client (for React frontend)

/server (for Node.js backend)

2. Initialize Backend (Node.js + Express + Socket.io)
bash
mkdir server
cd server
npm init -y
npm install express socket.io mongoose cors

Create server.js in /server.

Set up Express and Socket.io for real-time communication.

Do the node server.js run in the onamtrail directory itself or issue arises also after node serves.js happens .




Created git commit.

Success! Created client at E:\onamtrial\client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd client
  npm start
